# CellDepot: A unified repository for scRNAseq data and visual exploration
CellDepot serves as an integrated web application to assist users in exploring the single-cell RNAseq datasets and comparing the datasets among various studies through a user-friendly interface with advanced visualization and analysis tools. It also provides an efficient data management system that users can upload single cell data and query the database by multiple attributes such as species, cell types. Embedding cellxgene VIP tool into each dataset facilitates the interactive visualization and analysis of large-scale scRNAseq data. Moreover, the advanced query function, incorporated with MySQL and its conditional filtering, allows the users to quickly query and compare the expression of the target gene or gene sets across the datasets of interest. Finally, CellDepot enables further exploration of a dataset to gain more refined insights such as cell composition, gene expression changes, differentially expressed genes between cell types. This web portal for sharing data and supporting decision-making allows scientists to contribute to the single-cell community in a tractable and collaborative manner.
