This is a supplemental tutorial provides a detailed guide. Figure S1. CellDepot website The interface contains multiple tabs, corresponding to import and/or select objects in CellDepot scRNA-seq database, that can be accessed on top panel of the webpage. Users can upload their own dataset or explore the existing datasets for visualization and analysis. 4.1 Browse Projects 4.1.1 Search Projects This function allows the user to search any targeted interests, which also can be accessed through search projects on the top panel of the webpage. Users is allowed to select the projects by 17 attributes: annotation groups, cell count, cellxgene VIP launch method, Custom accession, description, DOI, file name, file size, gene count, name, notes, PMC ID, Publication Title, PubMed ID, Species, URL, Year. These 17 fields can also be (partially) displayed on the webpage through column setting on the webpage. Users can also search projects by the keywords via the search function on the right of the webpage. In addition, by column setting, users can set up the customized layout of targeted projects; thereby exporting to csv format. Figure S3. Workflow of how to search query on Browse Projects page. 4.1.1.1 Case study 1 Six datasets are filtered when searching by Species is Human and Annotation Group contains Neuron. Figure S4. Data Filtering. Query search of Species is Human and Annotation Groups contains Neuron brings about nine datasets of interest. 4.1.1.2 Case Study 2 Cross-project comparison of skeletal muscle marker genes PAX3, PAX7, PITX2, MYF5, MYF6, MYOD1, MYOG, NEB, and MYH3 among the datasets whose species is human and cell type is myogenic. Figure S5. Workflow of how to conduct the cross-project comparison of gene sets among the selected datasets. For each project, users can view the datasets information, visualize data analysis, and conduct update through clicking on View Details, cellxgene VIP, and Update links, respectively. 4.1.2 Project Filters This page provides the matched datasets by simply clicking the categories. It is a first-time user-friendly functionality as users may not be familiar with the content of the database. The advance search function is the same as that on the Browse Projects page (4.1.1). Figure S6. The layout of Project Filters page. 4.2 Visaulize Datasets 4.2.1 View Details The datasets information consists of project summary and annotation groups. The project summary is provided by each user when uploading projects. The information of annotation groups is retrieved from uploaded .h5ad file. Figure S7. Visualization of details of datasets. 4.2.2 Update Project summary information can be updated on Browse Project page with Preload in Memory cellxgene VIP launch method via click Update hyperlink. Figure S8. Update project on Browse Project page. 4.2.3 Data Visualization and Analysis CellDepot is not only a database management system, but also a web portal to visualize the scRNA-seq dataset. Here, we embed cellxgene and cellxgene VIP in CellDepot. By clicking Cellxgene VIP, data analysis results can be visualized. Detailed guides of cellxgene and cellxgene VIP, please go to https://interactivereport.github.io/cellxgene_VIP/tutorial/docs/. Figure S9. See visualization of selected datasets. 4.2.3.1 Case study 1 Exploration and visualization of the expression of gene(s) across the cluster of cells under various conditions. As shown in Figure S10a, two cell groups from Astrocytes (1036 cells) and Oligodendrocytes (4417 cells) are selected. By running differential analysis with one of the built-in statistical methods such as Welchs t-test, we detected 1578 differential expressed genes (DEGs), including 715 up-regulated and 853 down-regulated genes in astrocytes compared to oligodendrocytes (Figure S10a). The expression of the top four DEGs among the cell types indicates that gene MBP, ST18 and RNF220 are expressed explicitly in oligodendrocytes, while gene PITPNC3 is expressed mainly in astrocytes and endothelial cells (Figure S10b). In the future, we plan to add other multi-omics data modalities, which can be incorporated and integrated with scRNA-seq, such as spatial transcriptomics and scATAC-seq data. Figure S10. Exploration of differential expressed genes in dataset GSE140231 through cellxgene VIP. (a) Differential expressed genes in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. (b) The expression of top four genes in different cell types. 4.3 Search Genes This tab allows searching on targeted genes with cell count cutoff and expression cutoff. The search outcome provides users every project contains the targeted genes. Each project displays a link to project page and a figure plot if applicable. This plot can be either violin plot or dot plot shows the gene expression level in each annotation groups. Figure S11. The layout of Search Genes 4.4 Upload Projects To upload new projects in CellDepot database, two files are required: 1) .h5ad files and 2) project information in csv format. Detailed formatting guidance can be found by Download Example File hyperlink on webpage. In addition, two cellxgene VIP launch methods are provided: standard and preload in memory. Standard mode is for the first-time imported datasets, while preload in memory should be chosen when users update the meta information of datasets. After the projects are submitted, CellDepot will automatically analyze the datasets. To explore the detail of uploaded datasets, users can navigate to browse projects page and then search the imported datasets by the customized accession number. Figure S2. Workflow of how to import personal datasets. 4.5 How to set up cron job? The following cron job entry is needed to convert h5ad file to CSC format on the background, @hourly &lt;user-name&gt; cd /var/www/html/celldepot/app/core; php ./api_toCSCh5ad.php Please make sure that the user has the permission to write in the data directory. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed). You may want to try searching to find the page's new location, or use the table of contents to find the page you are looking for. "]]
